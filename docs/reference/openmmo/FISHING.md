# Fishing

**Planned progression change (2026-09-14):** fishing will use learned abilities or licenses with a small number of tiers, such as Basic and Advanced Fishing, without mana costs or use-based XP. Tier requirements, effects, and migration of existing characters remain to be designed. See [the skills design](MANA_SKILLS_MAGIC.md). The sections below describe the current XP/level implementation.

Cast a rod at water, wait for the bite, hook in time, land the fish. The first
gathering profession, and the first consumer of the trained-skill system
(`shared/src/skills.rs`). Server-authoritative end to end: every timer, roll
and outcome lives in `server/src/game_state/fishing.rs`; clients render
broadcasts and answer with `FishingRespond`.

## The loop

```
FishingCast ─► Casting (1 s) ─► Waiting (4–12 s, skill-shortened)
                                    │ bite rolls the fish (species/size/trophy)
                                    ▼
                              Bite (2.5 s + 0.5 s latency grace)
                              │ Hook in time      │ too late / never
                              ▼                   ▼
                            Fight              Escaped
              (continuous reel/give-line tension sim)
                              │ exhaust + reel in  │ line snaps / hook thrown
                              ▼                    ▼
                           Caught               Escaped
```

**Getting a rod:** buy a Fishing Rod from a general merchant (Rica stocks it
for 3 silver — a starter tool between a torch and a potion) and equip it in
the main hand.
Rods are excluded from dungeon treasure chests — they are bought tools, not
endgame combat loot (`server/src/item_defs.rs::equipment_ids_with_min_price`).

- **Cast** (`FishingCast { position }`): needs a fishing rod in the main hand
  (`category == "fishing_rod"`), the overworld floor, a target within 8 m, and
  **water**. Water is `waterSurfaceY − terrainBed > 0.1 m` at the target,
  sampled server-side from the baked **unified water field** (WFD1, sea +
  rivers) via `terrain::WaterSampler` alongside the terrain `HeightSampler`.
  This is true over the **ocean** (surface at sea level, bed below) AND over
  **rivers** (the carved channel surface sits above its bed even high in the
  hills — a river bed bottoms out at sea level and climbs, so the older
  "terrain height < 0" test wrongly rejected every inland river). On land the
  water surface collapses below the terrain, so `depth ≤ 0` and the cast is
  refused with a direct `FishingError`. Sea-only tiles have no baked water
  file; they sample as flat sea level, matching the client's synthesis.
  On a rowboat, the target must also lie within 45° of the stern; casting
  preserves the boat's heading and the seated angler's stern-facing pose.
- **Wait**: uniform 4–12 s, shortened 2% per fishing level (floored at half
  the minimum). The fish — species, size, trophy — is rolled *at the bite*,
  not at resolution. Trophy status is revealed at the hook; species and
  exact size are revealed on landing.
- **Bite** (`FishingBite` broadcast): the bobber dips. `Hook` must arrive
  within 2.5 s plus 0.5 s latency grace — judged against the server's own
  clock, so a laggy-but-in-time click is never punished and a hacked client
  can't stretch the window. Hooking *early* (before the bite) scares the fish
  off. The reaper tick allows one extra grace period before declaring an
  unanswered bite escaped, so a response racing the deadline is judged by the
  handler, not the tick.
- **End** (`FishingEnded { outcome }` broadcast): `Caught { item_def_id,
  size_cm, trophy }`, `Escaped`, or `Aborted`. A caught fish arrives through
  the normal `InventoryUpdated` (fish stack by species and trophy variant — exact size is
  announced, not stored), or spills as a ground item when the
  bag can't take the weight — never silently lost. Moving, attacking,
  disconnecting, dying, stowing the rod (unequipping it, or swapping a
  weapon into the main hand), or `FishingStop` aborts the session; gear
  changes that leave the rod in hand — a hat, an off-hand torch — don't
  break concentration.

Timers advance on a 250 ms server tick (`run_ticks` in `main.rs`) using
`tokio::time::Instant`, so the whole state machine is tested with paused time
(`server/src/game_state/tests.rs`, `fishing_tests`).

## The catch table

Anything with a `catchWeight` in `data-src/items.csv` can end up on the
hook — fish (`category: "fish"`), junk flotsam, and coin catches alike.
The catch columns:

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `rarityTier` | fish: 1 (common) … 5 (legendary); junk/coins: 0 — drives XP and skill weighting |
| `catchWeight` | relative weight in the catch table at fishing level 0 |
| `minFishingLevel` | fishing level a species is locked behind (blank = 0) |
| `sizeDice` | rolled length in cm (e.g. `6d8`) |
| `trophyCm` | fish only — length at or above this is a trophy |

Species pick: weighted draw over two pools. A fish's weight grows
`RARITY_SKILL_BONUS_PCT` (3%) per level per rarity tier — multiplicative, so
skill closes the gap on rare fish but can never invert the table's order.
Flotsam holds a flat `FLOTSAM_SHARE_PCT` (20%) of the draw at every level,
so junk never thins out as the fish pool grows. `minFishingLevel` locks a
species until the angler earns it: salmon at 10, golden sturgeon at 20.
Size uses `sizeDice`. Each fish has a 20% trophy roll, which doubles its
size and guarantees trophy status. A failed roll can still produce a trophy
if the ordinary size meets `trophyCm`. Junk never becomes a trophy.
With the fixed 20% flotsam share, trophies occur on about 16–17% of all
bites (about 84% chance of at least one in ten bites). Landing one still
requires winning its high-tension fight.

Fish are sellable (`basePrice`, ordinary merchant flow) and edible —
`category "fish"` uses the food eating effect. Fish stack by species and
trophy variant. Exact size is deliberately **not stored on the item**;
it lives only in the catch announcement.

Prices are anchored to the game's *income* economy, not just the catalog:
monster kills drop unsellable worn weapons by design, so the repeatable gold
faucets are coin piles (1–10c) and gated dungeon chests — and an NPC's
salary is 50s/day. Fish: minnow 10c, perch 25c, trout 60c, salmon 2s,
golden sturgeon 15s (the jackpot, a goblin-sword's worth — 1.7% of draws even
at the level-30 cap). With the flotsam rows in the table, the expected *sell*
value of one catch runs ~8c at level 0 to ~24c at the level-30 cap — a couple of coin
piles, so an hour of active fishing earns roughly half a guard's daily salary.
Steady pocket money, not a money printer. Final tuning is explicitly the
maintainer's call. That band is a **contract test**
(`item_defs::tests::expected_catch_value_stays_in_the_coin_pile_economy_at_every_level`):
it sweeps every fishing level, and fails if the per-catch EV leaves 5–25c, if
skill ever makes an angler poorer, or if the cap earns more than 4x level 0 —
mastery should pay a better wage, not open a different economy.

## Flotsam (junk & coin catches)

Not everything that bites is a fish. Four flotsam rows share the catch
table (a flat 20% of draws at every level): an **Old Boot** and a **Clump of Kelp**
(worthless bag junk — the classic fishing gag), a **Message in a Bottle**
(sells for a token 15c), and a **Sunken Coin Pouch**
(`category: "coin_catch"` — it lands in the bag sealed like any other
catch; opening it via `use_item` (double-click in the bag) rolls its
`dice` column, `3d8`, pays the copper to the wallet through the same
path as ground coin piles, and the combat log reports the amount). All are `rarityTier 0`: **no fishing XP** (the
`10·rarity²` formula grants nothing naturally), no trophy, and in the
fight they pull and tire like a common fish (`rarity.max(1)` clamps pull and
stamina). An *escaped* junk catch
still pays the flat 2 XP consolation — the species is never revealed on
an escape, and a varying consolation would leak the hidden roll. Junk
keeps the bite/struggle stakes honest without inflating income — the EV
guardrail above counts flotsam in its average.

## Skill

Catches grant fishing XP: `10 × rarity²` (10 for a minnow, 250 for a golden
sturgeon); a hooked fish that escapes consoles with 2. Fishing grants **no
character XP** — combat balance is untouched. Level effects today: shorter
waits, better rare weights, and drag control in the fight (`1%` less pull
tension and `1%` faster reeling per level, pull relief capped at 30%).

## Client

- Click water with a rod equipped → `cast_fishing` intent
  (`managers/inputHandler.ts`; water = the baked `WaterFieldManager.surfaceAt`
  sits >0.1 m above the clicked terrain, so both ocean and rivers cast while
  dry ground still walks) → stop, face the water, send (`PlayerControl.svelte`).
  The server re-validates, so the client check only decides cast-vs-walk.
  Rowboat casts keep the heading and reject clicks outside the stern cone
  before changing the player's state. The direction check is shared via WASM.
- `components/FishingBobber.svelte`: every nearby angler's bobber (broadcasts
  are radius-gated), gentle idle bob, hard dip on bite. The float stays
  hidden through the cast swing + flight and splashes down on the same
  schedule as the splash sound. A sagging white line connects the angler's
  rod tip to the float. During the fight it chases the fish's broadcast
  position (client-side smoothing — the 4 Hz beats are never snapped to) and
  wears a splash of droplets whose intensity follows the fish's remaining
  stamina — bystanders read the whole fight from the water.
- `components/FishingPrompt.svelte`: SPACE, any click, or a wheel flick to
  hook (clicks are captured before the canvas, so a hasty click can't walk
  the angler and abort the session), then the fight HUD — fish-state line,
  tension gauge, and two hold-to-act stance buttons. REEL: hold the button,
  hold SPACE, or wheel down (winding toward you); GIVE LINE: hold the
  button, hold S, or wheel up (wheel inputs are short bursts). ESC reels in.
  Combat-log lines narrate cast/bite/outcome.
- State in `stores/fishingStore.ts`; server messages handled in
  `network/messageHandlers.ts`.

## Agent parity

Agents speak the same protocol: `FishingBite` carries everything needed to
respond, and the windows (2.5 s + grace) are sized for an agent-client's
network round trip as much as for human reflexes — no mechanic requiring
reactions only software can deliver, none too fast for software either.

The agent-client implements this as a reflex layer (`src/state/events.rs`):
it auto-hooks its own bites and plays each `FishingFight` beat through the
shared `auto_stance` policy (answering only on change) — mechanically, like
its A* movement layer, while the LLM makes the decisions via two actions:
`{"type": "fish", "x": …, "z": …}` (coordinates optional — omitted means
"just ahead") and `{"type": "stop_fishing"}`. Outcomes come back to the
model as `[Fishing]` events; in-flight messages are classified as noise so
they cost no LLM calls.

Answers wait out a human reaction delay (`HOOK_REACTION_MS`,
`STANCE_REACTION_MS`) with one answer in flight, so a beat arriving
mid-reaction is missed exactly as a person misses it. Both ceilings are
load-bearing: the hook must still fit `BITE_WINDOW_MS`, the stance what the
fight absorbs (`the_stance_policy_survives_a_human_reaction_delay`).
Shortening a window means re-checking the pair.

## The fight

Hooking is only the start: the fight is a continuous tug-of-war simulated on
the server's 250 ms tick (constants in `shared/src/fishing.rs`, pure step in
`server/src/game_state/fishing.rs::step_fight`). The fish alternates
**Running** bursts (2–3.5 s, longer for rarer fish) and shorter **Resting**
breathers (0.8–2 s) — most of the fight is spent under pressure;
the angler holds one of three stances, changed any time via
`FishingRespond`: **reel**, **give line**, or **hold**.

- **Tension** (the gauge; snaps at 100, `Escaped`): a Running fish pulls
  `(20 + 2·rarity)/s`, scaled up to 1.3× by how much line is out and down by
  skill; reeling adds 14/s (more than the 8/s rest decay — the reel can
  never simply be held); giving line sheds 44/s (always more than the
  strongest pull). The hook-set itself opens the fight at 30 — deliberately
  hot: an unanswered run leaves the safe range in about a second and snaps
  the line in a few.
- **Distance** (shown, not numbered: the bobber *is* the fish): runs take
  ~1.1–1.5 m/s of line, reeling takes it back (1.6 m/s vs a Resting fish,
  0.6 against a run, 2.5 when Exhausted). The fish wanders but stays within
  6 m of the cast point, and can never be reeled past the session's **line
  floor**: the cast handler walks the player→cast ray (0.5 m steps, the same
  tiles the cast validation touched — the tick stays IO-free) to find where
  fishable water starts, and the fight clamps to that plus 0.4 m, at least
  the rod's 2 m reach. The exhausted reel-in also steers the fish back onto
  the cast ray, so it comes home along the line whose waterline was actually
  measured — the float stays on the water instead of climbing the shore.
- **Stamina** (shown on the HUD and in the splash): only drag
  burns it — Running under ≥20 tension costs `2 + 12·(tension/100)²` per
  second; the square means timid mid-band play barely tires the fish and
  real progress comes from riding the gauge near the top, while a slack
  line lets a Resting fish *recover*. Pools are `38 + 12·rarity`.
- **Endgame**: at 0 stamina the fish goes **Exhausted** — reel it down to
  the line floor (within 0.3 m) and it lands (`Caught`). A lively fish
  dragged within 1 m of the floor panics into a fresh run instead, so only
  a spent fish can ever be landed. A fight
  that reaches 60 s (40 s for trophies) throws the hook (`Escaped`): slack-line stalling is not
  a strategy, and neither is walking away (unmanaged tension snaps within
  seconds).

Trophy status is rolled at the bite, using `TROPHY_ROLL_CHANCE_PCT` or
the species-size threshold. It is announced on the first fight beat and stays
fixed through landing. Trophy fish drain stamina only while Running at
**80 or higher tension**. After first reaching 80 during a run, each full
second spent continuously below 80 while Running rolls a 1/3 chance to
lose the hook (three seconds on average, not a fixed deadline). Reaching
80 or entering Resting resets that timer. The initial pressure buildup and
exhausted reel-in are exempt. Below 80 they do not tire; resting on slack line
still restores stamina. Their tension changes at 40% of the ordinary
rate so the narrow high-tension band is playable with human reaction delay.
There is no final score gate: an exhausted trophy lands normally, while a
snapped line or timeout awards no fish. The shared agent reflex uses the
same trophy flag and reacts with its usual delay.

Successful trophies award exactly one `trophy_*` fish: a separate stack
with the same species icon, twice its ordinary weight, and three times its
base price. It remains edible and grills into the ordinary cooked fish.
Catch XP and species titles are granted once as before. Ordinary catches
are unchanged. There is no second-fish roll or accumulated bonus chance.

Every beat is broadcast as `FishingFight { bobber, fish_state, tension_pct,
stamina_pct, trophy }` — public information by design, which is what keeps humans
(reading gauge and splash) and agent-clients (running the shared
`auto_stance` policy on a human reaction delay, below) on equal footing.
Trophy catches are celebrated to everyone in delivery radius via the
`FishingEnded` broadcast they already receive.

## Deliberate limits

- No bait, no rod tiers, no designated fishing spots (any water — ocean or
  river — works).
- Animations are in: a Mixamo cast plays once on `FishingCasted`, then a
  fishing idle loops until the line comes in (`fishing.glb` pack, local
  player only — remote anglers still read through the bobber). SFX are in:
  the line whirs out on the swing, the splash lands with the bobber a second
  later, plop on bite, reel click when the reel stance engages, line snap on escape,
  jingle on catch (CC0 packs except the contributor-original cast whir —
  see `assets/sfx.md`; self-only, matching the combat sound precedent).
